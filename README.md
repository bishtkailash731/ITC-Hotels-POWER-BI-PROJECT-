💡 Sample Insights 📉 Week 21 had the lowest occupancy — targeted promotions can help fill the gap.

📈 Guests booking 10+ days in advance tend to stay longer and cancel less.

🎯 ALOS below 2 days impacts profitability — promote longer stay deals.

⚠️ High cancellation rates are linked to short lead-time bookings.

📌 Recommendations Implement dynamic pricing to optimize RevPAR.

Offer discounts for extended stays to increase ALOS.

Promote non-refundable bookings to reduce cancellation losses.

Run weekday promotions to balance low-demand periods.
